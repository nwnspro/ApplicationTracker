# Job Hunting Tracker

A simple yet effective tool to track your job applications (with separate tables for full-time career positions and casual part-time gigs), view statistics (so you can properly document how brutal the job market isâ€”apply to 1000, get ghosted by 999), and mark roles you're interested in to save them to your todo list while you're busy polishing your CV so you won't forget about it later.
